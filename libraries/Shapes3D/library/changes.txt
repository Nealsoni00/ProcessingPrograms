V2.1.5

When two shapes overlapped it was possible that anti-aliasing could cause 
another shape altogether to be picked . Pick buffer mow uses the noSmooth 
option to prevent this occurring. (reported and solution provided by Eron Gjoni)

A bug in the shape picking algorithm that caused numerous 'misses' has now
been fixed. Recommend you read API for Shapes3D.pickShape(...)
